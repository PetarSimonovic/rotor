Skipping rope fitness game in development for Apple Watch and iPhone

Use a skipping rope to propel yourself  across a virtual landscape. 

Chain jumps to fly and accelerate.

Stop jumping and you'll drop.


Rotor is in the early stages of development. It currently:

  - creates a Perlin noise map and uses that to generate a 3D landscape;  
  - establishes the iPhone-Watch connection;
  - reads a 'skip' from the watch (a jump and a turn of the wrist), albeit somewhat inaccurately.

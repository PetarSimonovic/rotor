Skipping rope fitness game in development for Apple Watch and iPhone

Use a skipping rope to propel yourself  across a virtual landscape. 

Chain jumps to fly and accelerate.

Stop jumping and you'll drop.


Rotor is in the early stages of development. It currently:

  - generates a 3D landscape using Perlin noise;  
  - establishes the iPhone-Watch connection;
  - reads the Y-axis of the Watch accelerometer.
